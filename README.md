# OrderingTest

## Description 
iOS Challenge for Ordering 


## Architecture
- I decide to use clean architecture to modularise our project, this kind of architectures isn't recommended in small projects because require more files, more complexity and more time to deploy a new component, but as advantage you get a best control of each component, get the facility to reuse your code easily, get the opunity to replace code like change your database administrator from CoreData to Realm or SwiftData easily.
- Each feature has been implemented using the MVVM architecture. This is the common and suggested architecture in SwiftUI.
